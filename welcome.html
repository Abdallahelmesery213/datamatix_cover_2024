                        <h5>OUR NEXT 30 YEARS</h5>
                        <p>
                            Due to the globalization revolution and its technological impact, the world around us is changing at an unprecedented rate; fueled by the new media and the shrinking distances between nations, we face a stream of information every day. We are living a new reality and I am profoundly grateful that when Datamatix completes 30 years, it will be in the spirit of embracing the future. I have immensely enjoyed the progress of Datamatix during the last 30 years. With our commitment and determination, we have reached the forefront and are currently in touch with global leaders in business, economy, technology and politics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Datamatix, we firmly believe in the ability and the responsibility to make a change and create a great deal of difference - by promoting development and enhancing economic empowerment, by providing the knowledge needed to overcome challenges, by achieving sustainable development, by breaking the barriers to economic growth, and by closing the digital segregation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As borders disappear, people move without restraint, and information and ideas grow too, at a spectacular pace. In today's open society, Datamatix and counterpart organizations can play the crucial role of developing and providing the latest well-run knowledge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the recent changes in open markets and public investments by wealthy nations in developing countries in various fields such as education, health care and the environment, as well as improved governance in those countries themselves, the Middle East region and the world can develop a future in which prosperity is shared more widely and potential realized more fully than before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Competition provides a momentum for growth; it increases motivation and innovation and creates livelihoods locally, regionally and globally. However, we must do more to improve education and job-training so that more people have the skills to compete in a world that is changing very rapidly. The region's countries must be less resistant and reluctant to required changes, so that vigorous economic competition does not become a race to the bottom, but a race to the top.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, it's important to acknowledge that trade alone cannot lift nations from poverty, whereas innovation and reinvention can. And it is the aim of Datamatix to support and inspire this innovation amongst people and organizations through its various events, awards and services.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Victor Hugo said, "There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come." The reverse is also true: There's no bigger curse than a big idea that hangs on after its time has gone. And for these reasons, I hope all of us will give this a thought; no generation has ever had the opportunity that we have now to build a regional and global economy that leaves no one behind and, in the process, creates a new century of peace and prosperity for the Middle East and the world. As it clearly seems a wonderful opportunity, it is also a profound responsibility.

                            For the past 30 years, we at Datamatix have done what we could to bring the latest knowledge and understanding to guide our region towards the best practices in ICT, leadership, economy and women empowerment, and we hope to continue doing so for many more decades to come.

                        <p>
                            We at Datamatix believe that knowledge is homogeneously the most important catalyst to shape the lives of young people and spur true economic development in this region. Every single person in the society must work to bring the latest knowledge, share the best practices and build the best infrastructure to make the region and the world, as a whole, successful and hence build hope for the future.

                            Datamatix is dedicated to the task of preparing the Middle East and other global entities for the new global economy, as we all know that globalization is clearly tearing down barriers and building new networks and bridges among nations, peoples, cultures and organizations at an astonishing and historically unprecedented rate. This phenomenon has been fueled by an explosion of ICT which enables information, ideas and money, people, products and services to move within and across national borders at increasingly greater speed and volume.

                        <p>
                            In such a fast pace world, it becomes pivotal for us to be continuously updated about the latest trends and developments, in order to get hold of the opportunities presented by the global economy.

                        <p>
                            Now, as we look forward to our 30th anniversary, we hope to see you at the celebrations in order to share our vision of the region's future together. I thank you all for your patronage, support and friendship.

                                At Datamatix, we have worked hard over these past years to establish a strong identity as a knowledge resource for the region. Our mandate has always been to develop multinational partnerships, create valuable dialogue with people around the world, and nurture friendships. From the very beginning our aim was to tear down regional and global barriers and build bridges between people, cultures, and organizations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have enjoyed immensely the progress of the last years - it was not always easy, but it was always challenging. It is our commitment and our determination that have brought Datamatix to the forefront and in touch with global leaders in business, economy, technology and politics. Globalization need not benefit only advanced nations. Indeed, in developing countries too, it brings the promise, but not the guarantee of a better future.
                            </p>

                                For years, we at Datamatix have endeavored to introduce the latest ICT knowledge, build leadership skills, help improve the economy, empower women - and more in our region. And we hope to continue doing so for many more decades, we believe that knowledge is the single most important catalyst that will shape the lives of young people and spur true economic development.

                                Today we are embarking on a new journey for our next years. A particularly significant element of this process is the emergence of a global media that delivers information in a flash, everywhere from Brazil to the UAE to China and beyond. In a single hour today, more people and goods move from city to city, country to country, continent to continent than moved in the entire 18th or 19th centuries. We are living a new reality and are pleased that, Datamatix today looks forward to dealing with the long term challenges affecting not just region, but the world.                            
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the beginning of this the new century and new millennium, half of the world's people are still struggling to survive. These trends and other troubling ones are likely to be worsened by a rapidly growing population that is expected to increase by 50% in the first half of this century. So the great question before us is not whether globalization will proceed, but how? And what is the responsibility of the developed world to try to shape this process so that it lifts people in all nations?

                                We all have both the ability and the responsibility to make a great deal of difference by promoting development and economic empowerment, by providing the knowledge needed to face challenges, by achieving sustainable development, by breaking the barriers to economic growth, and by closing the digital divide.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As borders disappear, the freedom of movement of people, information and ideas grows too at a spectacular pace. In today's open society, Datamatix and counterpart organizations can and will play the crucial role of developing and providing the latest knowledge.

                                Ignorance is no longer an excuse. We can choose not to act, but we can no longer choose not to know, regardless of whom we are and where we live. With the new changes in open markets; public investments by wealthy nations in education, health care and the environment in developing countries; and improved governance in those countries themselves, the Middle East region can develop a future in which prosperity is shared more widely and potential realized more fully than before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We must do more to improve education and job-training, so that more people have the skills to compete in a world that is changing very rapidly. The region's countries must be less resistant change, so that spirited economic competition does not become a race to the bottom. It's important that we acknowledge that trade alone cannot lift nations, while innovation and reinvention can. And it is our aim, at Datamatix, to encourage and inspire this innovation amongst regional people and organizations through our varied events, awards, and services.
                            </p>

                                The digital divide is real - even in growing economies. Today, the citizens of South Asia are far less likely to have access to the internet than Americans. It is estimated that in 2020, in the Asian Pacific region, the top eight economies will have 72% of their people online; but the bottom 11 will have less than 4%. If that happens, the global economy really will resemble a world-wide web - a bunch of interlocking strands with huge holes in between.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An important question for our age is: Are computers and ICT a real solution for people who are starving or illiterate? Are eCommerce, eBusiness and eGovernment the right answers for villages that don't even have electricity? Other vital infrastructures have to be built in tandem with ICT to guarantee basic essentials for people who live at poverty level.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Victor Hugo said, there's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. The reverse is also true: there's no bigger curse than an idea that hangs on after its time has gone. No generation has ever had the opportunity we all now have to build a regional and global economy that leaves no one behind and, in the process, and to create a new century of peace and prosperity for the Middle East and for the entire world. It is a wonderful opportunity - and a profound responsibility.
